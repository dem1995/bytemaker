# bytemaker
## What is it?
`bytemaker` is a package for byte serialization/deserialization. More specifically, though, its goal is to port C bitfield functionality over to Python in version 3.8, as there are applications out there that have not made the jump to 3.9 for Windows 7 compatibility reasons.
